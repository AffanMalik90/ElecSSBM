Electrochemical Solver for 3D microstructures
Smoothed boundary method[] is employed to solve simultaneous electrochemical phenomena on a non-conformal grid system. The equation solved can be found in detail in [], and []. 
This tool can work with any given set of material properties and any give microstructure data.
